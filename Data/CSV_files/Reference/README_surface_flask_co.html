The 3-letter site identification code for Ushuaia, Argentina (TDF) was 
changed to USH to be consistent with the WMO GAWSIS. 

2011-10-07

We have introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR)
University of Colorado Boulder that made the actual measurement.  We can 
now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace gas species 
in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

We have also changed the file naming convention (see section "DATA - FILE 
NAME DESCRIPTION").

Method codes and sample locations were edited for accuracy.
Edited sites are: ZEP, BKT, OXK, CGO, RPB, ASC, CHR, ICE,
KEY, KUM, and TAP

2016-07-07

Incorrect sample dates from Ulaan Uul, Mogolia (UUM) from
20 Aug. 2013 through 30 Sept. 2015 were corrected on 
13 May 2016.

2016-07-07

Since 24 Jan 2015, air samples from Negev Desert, Isreal (WIS)
are collected at 29.9731N, 35.0567E, 156 masl; the old location 
was 30.8595N, 34.7809E, 482 masl.

2016-07-07

Since 03 Dec 2015, sampling in Natal, Brazil (NAT) was moved
from 5.5147S, 35.2603W, 20 masl to 5.7952S, 35.1853W, 87 masl.

2015-11-20

Updated the content and format of event files to include elevation in 
meters above sea level (masl) and sample collection intake height in 
meters above ground level (magl). Elevation plus collection intake 
height equals altitude, which has always been included in the NOAA 
distribution. In adding these 2 fields, the event number column
has moved. The new format is described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.

Users may find minor changes (from earlier distributions) to reported 
monthly mean values for the beginning months of data records.  These 
changes are due to minor corrections to our curve fitting methods as
first described by Thoning et al. (JGR,1989).

2013-08-27

Coordinates of some of the sample locations have changed.
These changes improve the specified location based on new
information.  Changes tend to be minor and do not necessarily
reflect a change in the actual sampling location.

2011-10-01

The data file format has been modified to include the measurement group
and, additionally, the sample collection and analysis times 
now include second information (e.g., 2011 03 15 23 06 12).  See 
section 7.3 for details.

2010-10-01

The format of the NOAA ESRL data records has been changed to include
an estimate of the uncertainty associated with each measurement.  The
determination of the estimate is trace gas specific and described in
section 6 (INTRODUCTION).

Parameter-specific notes:

The carbon monoxide data contained in these files supercede 
all previous measurement results. Data are referenced to the 
most recent WMO scale - WMO CO_X2014A.

Released in Dec 2015, the new scale was developed using the
calibration results of secondary standards against six sets 
of primary standards, Three of these were not previously 
available. The additional primaries standards allow better 
estimation of drift in reference gases.  

The conversion of previous results to the new scale used the
archived instrument signals from the sample and standard
measurements. The original response curves used for the GC-HgO 
instruments were reconstructed using the raw instrument signals 
of the standards with their new CO assignements on the X2014A 
scale. The sample mole fractions were recalculated against the 
new curves. 

A description of CO_X2014A and the revision of previous measurements
is available at: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccl/co_scale.html

Until the 2017 data release, if a flask pair differed 
by less than three ppb the samples were accepted, otherwise they were flagged 
and not used in further analysis (Novelli et al., 1998). 
Given the variability in CO mixing ratio and our measurement noise, 
we are in the process of revising the CO pair agreement criteria to be 4 ppb. 
This allows us to have more retained sample pairs while still 
requiring a reasonable agreement between paired flasks.  
The 2017 data and some of the recent years use this new criteria. 
All data will use this new criteria in the next release.

The flask data will be reprocessed and uncertainty estimates
will be available with the next CO calibration scale revision
scheduled in 2019.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. INTRODUCTION

For the past two decades CO has been measured in discreet samples
of air collected as part of the NOAA Collaborative global air
sampling network. Two analytical methods were used.  From 1988 to 
2008 instruments based on gas chromatography and HgO reduction detection
were used (GC-HgO, instruments from Trace Analytical Inc.)  
The instruments had a nonlinear response over the range 
of the remote troposphere (Novelli et al., 1991).  Response curves 
composed of 4-8 standards defined instrument response (Novelli et al., 
1994, 1998).

In 2008 an analyzer based on CO fluorescence in the vacumm ultra violet
(VUV, Gerbig et al.,1996) replaced one of the two GCs on the measurement 
system. The remaining GC and the VUV instrument were calibrated using a 
common set of reference gases, ranging from 50 to 350 ppb. In 2010 the 
last GC was replaced by a VUV instrument.  

The data in these files were collected on site in evacuated glass flasks 
or using a portable air sampling pump package. Two air samples were 
collected in series nearly simultaneously, constituting a pair (Lang 
et al., 1989 a,b). Quality of the air samples were evaluated by the 
difference between the two flasks.  Until the 2017 data release, 
if they differed by < three ppb the samples were accepted, 
otherwise they are flagged and not used in further analysis 
(Novelli et al., 1998). Given the variability in CO mixing ratio 
and our measurement noise, we are in the process of revising 
the CO pair agreement to be 4 ppb. The 2017 data and some of the recent years 
use this new criteria. All data will use this new criteria in the next release. 
If one or both flasks have a sampling or analysis issue, the corresponding 
data is flagged with N or A in the first column and it should not be used. 
Data flags are described in details in Section 7.4.

A review of the four sets of primary standards prepared between 
1989-2000 suggested our working standards were drifting upward at 
rates of ~0.5-1 ppb year. A time dependant correction was applied to 
all air samples measured through 12/2000 (Novelli et al., 2003). It 
is now believed primary standards prepared 1999/2000 were biased.  
They were assigned new mole fractions based on their calibrations
versus primary standards prepared in 2006, 2011 and 2015 and the 
flask air measured against these standards were re-calculated. 

Instruments used in the analysis are identified in the data string
by their ID.  The GC-HgO instruments were R2,CS, R5 and R6.  
              The VUV instruments are V2, V3 and V4.

The flask data will be reprocessed and uncertainty estimates 
will be available with the next CO calibration scale revision 
scheduled in 2019.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Carbon monoxide mixing ratios in these files are reported 
in units of nmol/mol (10^-9 mole CO per mole of dry air 
or as part per billion by mole fraction (ppb)) relative
to the NOAA/WMO CO scale (Novelli et al., 1991, Novelli 
et al., 2003).  The reproducibility of the measurements, 
estimated from repeated analysis of air contained in a 
high-pressure cylinder, is ~1-2 ppb using GC-HgO, and 0.5 
ppb or better for the VUV instruments.

Two air samples are collected on site nearly simultaneously 
in glass flasks and constitute a pair. Samples are typically
collected using a semi-automated unit which incorporates a
powerful battery, a high capacity pump, ~5 m intake line,
and a back pressure regulator to control the pressure of 
air in the flasks.  Two air samples are collected in series         
and pressured to ~1.5 atm.  At a few sites air is sampled 
in evacuated glass flasks. Over time several versions of glass 
flasks and automatic samplers have been used; they are 
indentified in the data string.  

Sampling frequencies are approximately weekly for land sites.
Ships transecting the Pacific Ocean collect one sample pair 
every three weeks per five degree latitude zone. Cruise tracks
for the Pacific sampling program run between the US west coast 
and New Zealand or Australia. In the South China Sea one bin
sample pair was collected per week per 3 degree latitude. 
Details of the Cooperative Air Sampling Program can be found 
at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/flask.html.                                             

The Pacific Ocean Cruise (POC, travelling between the US west coast
and New Zealand or Australia) data have been merged and grouped into 
5 degree latitude bins.  For the South China Sea cruises (SCS) the 
data are grouped in 3 degree latitude bins.

Sampling intervals are approximately weekly for the fixed sites
and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for POC and
about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.

Historically, samples have been collected using two general methods:
flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump, or opening a
stopcock on an evacuated glass flask; since 28 April 2003, only the
former method is used.  During each sampling event, a pair of flasks 
is filled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - EVENT WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS

On special request we can distribute a "merged" file, which
includes for each sampling event, measurement results for muliple 
parameters or trace gas species.  A merged file does not include all 
information found in a single parameter data file.  For example,
merged files exclude measurement uncertainty, analysis instrument 
ID and date and time for each parameter.  Thus, the single parameter
data file is our most comprehensive data archive. 

The format of a merged file is slightly different from a single parameter event file.
A "merged" file will have the word "merge" in the parameter field of the file name.  
The file name does not inform on the number of parameters included in the file.

Merged data files use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     merge_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_[optional qualifiers].txt

(ex) merge_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg.txt contains ccgg measurement results for two or
     more parameters for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific Ocean Cruise 
     sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) merge_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg.txt contains ccgg measurement results for two or more
     parameters for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information followed by one 
record for each atmospheric measurement of a single parameter or trace gas species.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection date and time in UTC.
Field 3:    [MONTH]
Field 4:    [DAY]
Field 5:    [HOUR]
Field 6:    [MINUTE]
Field 7:    [SECOND]

Field 8:    [FLASK ID] The sample container ID.

Field 9:    [METHOD] A single-character code that identifies the sample 
             collection method.  The codes are:

             P - Sample collected using a portable, battery
                 powered pumping unit.  Two flasks are
                 connected in series, flushed with air, and then

            is the surface elevation plus sample intake height.

Field 13:   [ELEVATION] Surface elevation (masl).

Field 14:   [INTAKE HEIGHT] Air sample collection height above ground level (magl).

Field 15:   [EVENT NUMBER] A long integer that uniquely identifies the sampling
             event.


There is a group of 4 fields for each parameter and measurement group included in the 
merge file.

Field ##+1: [TRACE GAS NAME] Gas identifier (e.g., co2, co2c13).

Field ##+2: [MEASUREMENT GROUP] Identifies the group within NOAA and INSTAAR 
	     making the actual measurement (e.g., ccgg, hats, arl).

Field ##+3: [MEASURED VALUE] Dry air mole fraction or isotopic composition.  
             Missing values are denoted by -999.99[9].

Field ##+4: [QC FLAG] A three-character field indicating the results of our 
             data rejection and selection process, described in section 7.5.

Fields in each line are delimited by whitespace.

7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA ESRL uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.

7.6 DATA - MONTHLY AVERAGES

The monthly data files in ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/co/flask/surface/ 
use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     [parameter]_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_month.txt

(ex) CH4_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CH4 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific
     Ocean Cruise sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) CO2_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CO2 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

Monthly means are produced for each site by first averaging all
valid measurement results in the event file with a unique sample
date and time.  Values are then extracted at weekly intervals from 
a smooth curve (Thoning et al., 1989) fitted to the averaged data 
and these weekly values are averaged for each month to give the 
monthly means recorded in the files.  Flagged data are excluded from the
curve fitting process.  Some sites are excluded from the monthly
mean directory because sparse data or a short record does not allow a
reasonable curve fit.  Also, if there are 3 or more consecutive months
without data, monthly means are not calculated for these months.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information 
followed by one line for each available month.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection year and month.
Field 3:    [MONTH]

Field 4:    [MEAN VALUE] Computed monthly mean value

8. DATA RETRIEVAL

To transfer all files in a directory, it is more efficient to 
download the tar or zipped files.  

To transfer a tar file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.tar.gz       ! transfer the file
   3. ftp> bye                       ! leave ftp

   4. $ gunzip filename.tar.gz       ! unzip your local copy
   5. $ tar xvf filename.tar         ! unpack the file

To transfer a zipped file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.zip          ! transfer the file
   3. ftp> bye                       ! leave ftp

   4. $ unzip filename.zip           ! uncompress your local copy
