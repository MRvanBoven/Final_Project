The 3-letter site identification code for Ushuaia, Argentina (TDF) was 
changed to USH to be consistent with the WMO GAWSIS. 

2011-10-07

We have introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA and INSTAAR that made the actual measurement.
We can now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace 
gas species in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

We have also changed the file naming convention (see section "DATA - FILE 
NAME DESCRIPTION").

Project-specific notes:

2017-07-27

Method codes and sample locations were edited for accuracy.
Edited sites are: ZEP, BKT, OXK, CGO, RPB, ASC, CHR, ICE,
KEY, KUM, and TAP

2016-07-07

Incorrect sample dates from Ulaan Uul, Mogolia (UUM) from
20 Aug. 2013 through 30 Sept. 2015 were corrected on 
13 May 2016.

2016-07-07

Since 24 Jan 2015, air samples from Negev Desert, Isreal (WIS)
are collected at 29.9731N, 35.0567E, 156 masl; the old location 
was 30.8595N, 34.7809E, 482 masl.

2016-07-07

Since 03 Dec 2015, sampling in Natal, Brazil (NAT) was moved
from 5.5147S, 35.2603W, 20 masl to 5.7952S, 35.1853W, 87 masl.

2015-11-20

Updated the content and format of event files to include elevation in 
meters above sea level (masl) and sample collection intake height in 
meters above ground level (magl). Elevation plus collection intake 
height equals altitude, which has always been included in the NOAA 
distribution. In adding these 2 fields, the event number column
has moved. The new format is described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.

Users may find minor changes (from earlier distributions) to reported 
monthly mean values for the beginning months of data records.  These 
changes are due to minor corrections to our curve fitting methods as
first described by Thoning et al. (JGR,1989).

2013-08-27

Coordinates of some of the sample locations have changed.
These changes improve the specified location based on new
information.  Changes tend to be minor and do not necessarily
reflect a change in the actual sampling location.

2011-10-01

The data file format has been modified to include the measurement group
and, additionally, the sample collection and analysis times now include
second information (e.g., 2011 03 15 23 06 12).  See section 7.3 for
details.

2010-10-01

The format of the NOAA ESRL data records has been changed to include
an estimate of the uncertainty associated with each measurement.  The
determination of the estimate is trace gas specific and described in
section 6 (INTRODUCTION).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. INTRODUCTION

All samples were analyzed for SF6 at NOAA ESRL in Boulder, Colorado
by gas chromatography with election capture detection, and each sample 
aliquot was referenced to the NOAA X2014 SF6 standard scale 
The average repeatability of the analytical system is approximately 
0.04 ppt.  

Data files in the subdirectories "ccg/sf6/flask/event" and 
"ccg/sf6/flask/month" list SF6 dry air mole fractions in pmol/mol
based on measurements from the NOAA GMD Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global
Air Sampling Network. The subdirectory "event" contains all measurements
from air samples collected at each site and the subdirectory "month" contains
monthly means determined from the data files in "event". Network
sampling sites are listed in section 7.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Aliquots of gas from ambient air samples and a cylinder of reference 
gas are alternately injected into the gas chromatograph (GC) with a 
sampling valve.  Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is separated from other 
sample components using packed columns and detected with an electron 
capture detector (ECD). The response of the ECD to SF6 is calibrated 
off-line about monthly relative to the reference with a suite of 
standards. Each aliquot of sample is measured relative to the same 
reference, and SF6 values are calculated from the response function. 
SF6 measurements are reported in units of picomol/mol (10^-12 mol 
SF6 per mol of dry air (pmol/mol) or parts per trillion (ppt)) 
relative to the NOAA 2014 SF6 standard scale.  Reproducibility of 
our measurements (1 sigma), based on repeated analysis of air from a 
high-pressure cylinder, is approximately 0.04 nmol/mol over the 
period of our measurements. The absolute accuracy of our standard 
scale is estimated at 0.08 pmol/mol in the ambient atmospheric range 
of SF6 (95% confidence interval).

The Pacific Ocean Cruise (POC, travelling between the US west coast
and New Zealand or Australia) data have been merged and grouped into 
5 degree latitude bins.  For the South China Sea cruises (SCS) the 
data are grouped in 3 degree latitude bins.

Sampling intervals are approximately weekly for the fixed sites
and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for POC and
about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.

Historically, samples have been collected using two general methods:
flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump, or opening a
stopcock on an evacuated glass flask; since 28 April 2003, only the
former method is used.  During each sampling event, a pair of flasks 
is filled.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1.  Data for all species may not be available for all sites listed 
in the table.
2.  The exact location of a sampling site recorded in our database
may change or become better defined over time.  The latitude,
longitude, and altitude of a sample event is based on the best
information available at the time of sample collection.  Differences
in sample position associated with a particular site may be due
to the site moving or changes in technology that permit a more
accurate location determination.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - EVENT WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS

On special request we can distribute a "merged" file, which
includes for each sampling event, measurement results for muliple 
parameters or trace gas species.  A merged file does not include all 
information found in a single parameter data file.  For example,
merged files exclude measurement uncertainty, analysis instrument 
ID and date and time for each parameter.  Thus, the single parameter
data file is our most comprehensive data archive. 

The format of a merged file is slightly different from a single parameter event file.
A "merged" file will have the word "merge" in the parameter field of the file name.  
The file name does not inform on the number of parameters included in the file.

Merged data files use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     merge_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_[optional qualifiers].txt

(ex) merge_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg.txt contains ccgg measurement results for two or
     more parameters for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific Ocean Cruise 
     sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) merge_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg.txt contains ccgg measurement results for two or more
     parameters for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information followed by one 
record for each atmospheric measurement of a single parameter or trace gas species.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection date and time in UTC.
Field 3:    [MONTH]
Field 4:    [DAY]
Field 5:    [HOUR]
Field 6:    [MINUTE]
Field 7:    [SECOND]

Field 8:    [FLASK ID] The sample container ID.

Field 9:    [METHOD] A single-character code that identifies the sample 
             collection method.  The codes are:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA ESRL uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.6 DATA - MONTHLY AVERAGES

The monthly data files in ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/sf6/flask/surface/ 
use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     [parameter]_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_month.txt

(ex) CH4_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CH4 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific
     Ocean Cruise sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) CO2_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CO2 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

Monthly means are produced for each site by first averaging all
valid measurement results in the event file with a unique sample
date and time.  Values are then extracted at weekly intervals from 
a smooth curve (Thoning et al., 1989) fitted to the averaged data 
and these weekly values are averaged for each month to give the 
monthly means recorded in the files.  Flagged data are excluded from the
curve fitting process.  Some sites are excluded from the monthly
mean directory because sparse data or a short record does not allow a
reasonable curve fit.  Also, if there are 3 or more consecutive months
without data, monthly means are not calculated for these months.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information 
followed by one line for each available month.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection year and month.
Field 3:    [MONTH]

Field 4:    [MEAN VALUE] Computed monthly mean value

8. DATA RETRIEVAL

To transfer all files in a directory, it is more efficient to 
download the tar or zipped files.  

To transfer a tar file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.tar.gz       ! transfer the file
   3. ftp> bye                       ! leave ftp

   4. $ gunzip filename.tar.gz       ! unzip your local copy
   5. $ tar xvf filename.tar         ! unpack the file

To transfer a zipped file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.zip          ! transfer the file
   3. ftp> bye                       ! leave ftp

   4. $ unzip filename.zip           ! uncompress your local copy
