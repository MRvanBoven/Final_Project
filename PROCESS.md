# Process Book

## Day 2
* Plan: make prototype slider/map of monthly data from one year. Use [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org) to convert shapefiles to GeoJSON/TopoJSON files. (Later a Python script, using GeoPandas, could be used for this, if the prototype trial is successful.)
* I use the [Daily Sea Ice Extent Data File](ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv), because the monthly data files provided by [National Snow & Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/) lack some information. The extents of each month will be averaged in Pandas.

## Day 3
* Turns out [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org) converted my shapefiles to the wrong kind of coordinate system (probably Ordnance Survey National Grid). Luckily, [MyGeodata Converter](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-json) can convert them to TopoJSONs with WGS84 coordinates (which geoJSON/d3-geo expect per default). As input to that converter I gave all files in the downloaded shapefile zip (.cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx). I doesn't work with only a .shp file (whereas [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org) did). I'm not sure if I can write a Python script incorporating all these, or at least exporting a TopoJSON file in WGS84 coordinates. So now I have two possible courses of action:
  * convert the rest of 1979's months shapefiles via [MyGeodata Converter](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-json), test if I can load them into one TopoJSON, and see if the slider works out,
  * or try to write a Python script to convert my shapefiles to useful TopoJSONs.
* Development: [MyGeodata Converter](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-json) has a conversion limit of 3 datasets a month, so using this to convert all shapefiles doesn't seem like a good option (although incognito mode may provide a solution). It would be much nicer to have a working script for the conversion anyway. I did, however, convert three sets to useful topoJSONs, with which I can make a very simple test version of the slider.

## Day 4
* Installation of libraries (GeoPandas, GDAL and shapefile library) to manipulate and convert shapefiles all unsuccessful.
* Installation of command line [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/blob/master/README.md) succesful. (Finally!)

## Day 5
* No progress, due to illness.

## Day 6
* Files converted to WGS84 TopoJSONs with command line mapshaper are not compatible with D3 geo.
* Found [GeoConverter](https://geoconverter.hsr.ch/), an online converter that allows the output coordinate reference system (EPSG) to be defined as WGS84 (EPSG no. 4326), accept batch input, and can convert to output GeoJSON files.
* So now GeoJSON input in D3 instead of TopoJSON.
* Usable GeoJSONs of all maps dowloaded. Will now write a (python) script to combine those to one JSON file, in order to reduce input load on website.
* Simple slider was added to JavaScript script, to test map transitions with.

## Day 7
* JSONmerger.py works and outputs a very big json file containing all GeoJSONs.
* The file might be so large that it will be hard to use on my website. Options to fix this:
  * Put it online?
  * First convert all GeoJSONs to TopoJSONs, which are about 75% smaller. Problem now: converting to TopoJSON with mapshaper command line gives a file with presumably the wrong winding order, so the TopoJSON isn't functional yet.
  * Use only 20 or even 10 years of data. (Would be a shame, though.)

## Day 8
* Because I want to implement an option to filter on a specific month, I rearranged the JSONmerger a bit, to let months be the first keys, and years the second, so that the maps of a specific month can easily be selected.
* Using 10 years of data, instead of the full 40, gives rise to a file of about 25% the size of the full data, as expected. This is still quite some to process for the site, but it solves the loading problem partially. Because having more data in this case will show the decay of the arctic ice extent much better, for now I still opt for using all 40 years of data. However, showing 480 months on a slider might be a lot to ask, so perhaps 20 or 10 years will be chosen after all.
* For testing, I now use one year, so that the site loads rather fast.
* Found great [example of slider](https://bl.ocks.org/officeofjane/47d2b0bfeecfcb41d2212d06d095c763) with exactly the same features as I want for my visualisation, so implemented slider following this example.
* Slider needs to be made ordinal (with discrete month steps instead of continuous). This hopefully also solves current problem of not (always) reaching final value when using play button. (Although that might also (partially) be due to the if statement defining when to stop playing.) [Step slider example that might be useful](https://bl.ocks.org/shashank2104/d7051d80e43098bf9a48e9b6d3e10e73)
* Maps successfully linked to slider. No transition yet, would be nice for later.
* Issue that might also be solved with making slider ordinal: maps now updated for every minor movement of slider.

## Day 9
* Found atmospheric greenhouse gases concentration data, measured on Svalbard, by the [ESRL Global Monitoring Division](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/data/index.php?pageID=2&category=Greenhouse%2BGases&frequency=Monthly%2BAverages&site=ZEP]) The Svalbard part is great, because this is a location on the arctic.
* Here I found data about CH4, CO, CO2, NO2, and SF6, almost complete from 1998 to 2017. So hereby it's decided that I will also use the maps of this period.
* Concentration data missing: 2010-10 & 2010-11 CO2. From [this dataset](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/co2/flask/surface/co2_zep_surface-flask_1_ccgg_event.txt) of the same institute, it is clear that the values measured in this month were remarkably high and had a high uncertainty. This could have been due to measurement errors, equipment malfunction, or something of the sort. Because this data seems untrustworthy, it is not used to replace the missing data.
* Wrote Python script to combine all csv files into one JSON output file, with same nested structure as allmaps-JSON file (month = first key, year = second), with info of years 1998-2017. The similar structure will be useful for selecting data per month.

## Day 10
* Line chart added. By default it shows the ice extent area. Later, when greenhouse gas data can be added, a right side y axis might be needed, for the gases can probably use the same axis, but they cannot share the ice area axis. Another option is to change it into an area graph and show the ice area underneath the x axis, and the greenhouse gases above it.
* All scales (time, ice area, gases) are saved in an object, with the variable name corresponding to the scale as key. Like this they can be easily selected later, when data will be added to or removed from the line chart.
* All variable data was also converted to lists of objects like {"date": corresponding time, "value": value}. Like this they are easily accessible and compatible for the line graph, amongst other uses.
