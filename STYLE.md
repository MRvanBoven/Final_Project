## Style Rules as Drafted by Team J

### General
*  Be consistent!
*  Uphold the maximum of 80 characters per line of code.
*  Add a (multi line) comment atop every function, briefly explaining the purpose of the function.
*  Add a header comment atop the programme, with at least the programmer's name and student number, and a brief description of the functionality of the programme.
*  Write all code in functions, except for occasional global variables.
*  Use spaces around all mathematical signs, e.g. `let i = 3 + 4;`.


### JavaScript
*  Put semicolons after basically every expression that doesn't end in an accolade.
*  Use camelCase notation.
*  Always use `let`, `var` or `const` when defining a variable. Be consistent in the choice between the three options.


### D3
*  Use a new line for every added method, and keep the dots preceding these on the same indentation level. For example:
`let svg = d3.select("body")
            .append("svg")
            .attr("class", "slider")
            .attr("width", w)
            .attr("height", h);`

### CSS
*  Define static styles in CSS.

### Personal Style Preferences
*  Indentation when using D3...
